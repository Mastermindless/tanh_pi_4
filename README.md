# assymetric_tanh_pi_4()

This blog and GitHub repository introduces a novel concept of an asymmetric activation functions, one called asymmetric tanh pi 4 [assymetric_tanh_pi_4()], a biologically inspired activation function designed to simulate distributed neuron activation potentials, which potentially overcome the early neuron "death" problem of saturated functions.
