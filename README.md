# assymetric_tanh_pi_4()

This blog and GitHub repository introduces a novel concept of an asymmetric activation functions, one called asymmetric tanh pi 4 [assymetric_tanh_pi_4()], a biologically inspired activation function designed to simulate distributed neuron activation potentials, which potentially overcome the early neuron "death" problem of saturated functions.

Figure: Conceptual framework and empirical validation of the proposed activation function, asymmetrix_tanh_pi_4().
a) Example reference image from the CIFAR-10 dataset (class: cat).
b) Graphical comparison of the asymmetrix_tanh_pi_4() activation function and the tanh() function, highlighting different peak, symetry, and satruration behavior.
c) Saliency maps illustrating neuron activation in the final fully connected (Fc) layer of ResNet models: a shallower ResNet at 1x depth (top) and a 2x deeper ResNet at double depth (bottom). The deeper model with asymmetrix_tanh_pi_4() demonstrates significantly better gradient distribution, as evidenced by enhanced neuron activation across fully connected layer, supporting hypothesis of superior learning capacity for deeper DNN architectures.
